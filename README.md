# Communicate-Data-Findings
****
### In this project there are two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
#### 1. In Part I, Exploratory data visualization,  using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

#### 2. In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, by producing a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships I have discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying the findings will be through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
